% R.Henson, 17/3/03; rik.henson@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk
%
% General N-way (OxPxQxR...) repeated measures ANOVAs (no nonrepeated factors)
%
% Input:
%
% d = data	A matrix with rows = replications (eg subjects) and
%		              columns = conditions 
%
% D = factors	A vector with as many entries as factors, each entry being
%		the number of levels for that factor
%
%		Data matrix d must have as many columns (conditions) as
%		the product of the elements of the factor matrix D
%
%		First factor rotates slowest; last factor fastest
% 
% 	Eg, in a D=[2 3] design: factor A with 2 levels; factor B with 3:
%	    data matrix d must be organised:
%
%		A1B1	A1B2	A1B3	A2B1	A2B2	A2B3
% 	rep1
%	rep2
%	...
%	
% Output:
%
% efs 	= effect, eg [1 2] = interaction between factor 1 and factor 2
% F   	= F value
% cdfs 	= corrected df's (using Greenhouse-Geisser)
% p     = p-value
% eps   = epsilon
% dfs   = original dfs
% b     = betas
% y2    = cell array of means for each level in a specific ANOVA effect
% sig   = cell array of significant effects (uncorrected and Bonferroni corrected)
